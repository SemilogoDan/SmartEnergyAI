**SmartEnergyAI** is a web-based application designed to help users manage their energy consumption and costs effectively. It leverages **AI-driven predictions** and **automation** to provide real-time electricity price updates, calculate estimated daily and monthly costs, and automatically start or stop machines based on user-defined budgets. Additionally, it offers energy-saving suggestions by analyzing historical price data to identify the cheapest times to use energy.

This project is built using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. It utilizes **Chart.js** for visualizations and **SQLite** for storing user budgets and price history.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js for visualizations, Font Awesome for icons)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user budgets and energy data
- **AI/ML**: Predictive analytics for energy-saving suggestions
- **Automation**: Automated machine control based on real-time data and budget constraints

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - Users input their daily energy consumption, daily budget, and monthly budget.
   - These settings are saved to the database and used for cost calculations and machine control.

2. **Real-Time Price Updates**:
   - The application fetches the current electricity price from the backend and updates the UI every 10 seconds.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The system calculates the estimated daily and monthly costs based on the current price and user-defined consumption.

4. **Automatic Machine Control**:
   - The system checks if the estimated costs exceed the user's budget.
   - If the budget is not exceeded, the machine starts automatically.
   - If the budget is exceeded, the machine stops automatically.

5. **Energy Savings Suggestions**:
   - The system analyzes historical price data and suggests the cheapest times to use energy.

6. **Emergency Stop**:
   - Users can activate an emergency stop to override automatic machine control.
